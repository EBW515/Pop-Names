# Activity: Popular Names


## Instructions 
- As a team, you and your partner will complete the Popular Names Activity found in the DataComputing eBook <https://dtkaplan.github.io/DataComputingEbook/project-popular-names.html>  
    - You will choose at least four (4) names for the activity
    - Two names must be you and your partner (even if there is no data for one or both names)
    - The other two names can be anything you like (both must have data in `BabyNames`)
    - The plot shown at the beginning is the **goal** for the end of the activity, **NOT** the first task in the activity.
    - both partners should make commits in the Git Repo as you complete the activity
- every step in the activity should have narrative text describing your observations; many steps also require code chunks and corresponding output.
- Submit the completed R Notebook to Canvas before deadline

## Tips

- **always "PULL" before you do anything** when collaborating on a project controlled by GitHub to make sure you are working with the latest code (otherwise you'll have problems) 
- **always "PUSH" when you're done** so your collaborators can pull the latest version of the code.
- **always write descriptive commit messages** 
- Make sure you run all code chunks in your R Notebook before you "preview" the HTML document.  
- Make sure the HTML document that you submit to Canvas has rendered properly and is human readable!
